# ðŸš€ **High-Availability Trading Platform - System Design Report**

## **1. Overview**
This document presents the architecture for a **high-performance, low-latency trading platform** similar to Binance. 

The system follows a **microservices architecture on AWS**, leveraging **EKS (Kubernetes), API Gateway, DynamoDB, Aurora DB, Kinesis, CloudFront, and ElastiCache Redis**.

Due to time constraint, only 3 below features will be covered for this design:

  âœ… **Real-time order matching & execution**.  
  âœ… **Market data streaming for traders**.  
  âœ… **User account management, including balances and transaction history**.

## **3. Core Services && Workflow**

### **3.1 Order Placement Service**
ðŸ“Œ **Function:**  
- Receives and validates buy/sell orders from users.  
- Ensures the user has sufficient funds.  
- Forwards valid orders to the **Order Matching Engine**.  

### **3.2 Order Matching Engine**
ðŸ“Œ **Function:**  
- Matches buy and sell orders using a price-time priority algorithm.  
- Executes trades and updates **DynamoDB (trade history)** and **Aurora DB (balances)**.  
- Publishes real-time market data updates.  

### **3.3 User Account Management Service**
ðŸ“Œ **Function:**  
- Manages user authentication, balances, and withdrawals.  
- Handles compliance (KYC) and secure transaction logging. 

### **3.4 Workflow**
ðŸ”„ **User Interaction and Request Flow**:  
1. **User Access**: Users access the platform via a browser or app, sending DNS queries to Amazon Route 53, which resolves to Amazon CloudFront for low-latency delivery of static assets and API requests.  
2. **Traffic Distribution**: CloudFront routes static asset requests to the Application Load Balancer (ALB) and API/WebSocket requests to AWS API Gateway.  
3. **API Processing**:  
   - REST API requests (e.g., order placement) are sent to the Order Placement Service in EKS via API Gateway, which forwards orders to the Order Matching Engine.  
   - WebSocket connections enable real-time market data delivery, with AWS API Gateway routing updates from ElastiCache Redis (fed by Kinesis) back to users.  
4. **Data Management**:  
   - The Order Matching Engine stores trades in DynamoDB and streams market data to Kinesis, which caches in ElastiCache Redis for low-latency access.  
   - User account data is managed by the User Account Management Service, querying and updating Amazon Aurora DB, with backups sent to Amazon S3.  
   - Logs from EKS and trade history from DynamoDB are archived in S3 for long-term storage.  
5. **Monitoring and Observability**: Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray monitor EKS performance and trace WebSocket API requests, ensuring system health and debugging capabilities during high traffic or failures.

## 4. Component Choices

This section details the cloud services chosen for the architecture, their purposes, the rationale behind their selection, alternatives evaluated, and the final decisions justifying their use in the real-time trading platform.

### 4.1 Amazon Route 53
